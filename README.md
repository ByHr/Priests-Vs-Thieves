    -Priest vs thiefs.
  
  Project:
  
    -Game with online lobby system, players enter the lobby in groups of 4 or more. The game starts with each person (user) starting with 100 points. The players are given the choice each round to either "help" or "steal". If all players "help" then the collective whole is awarded 10 points. If a single player picks "steal" then they get 30 points. If more than 2 players pick "steal" in the same round then they each get deducted 20 points. After 10 rounds each players total points is revealed to the entire group and the player with the most points wins. The case of a tie is still to be determined (no one wins).
